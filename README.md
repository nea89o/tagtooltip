# Tag Tooltip

This mod adds a tooltip to every item which shows every tag an that item has. It was primarily created to be used in conjunction with Mekanisms Tag filter, which allows to tell machines on which items to operate. Since Mekanism didn't provide information how to get those tags, i created this mod to help with that.

## Added Features

 - Keybind "Show Ore Dictionary / Item Tags" under the "Inventory" category
    - This keybind shows the tags when hovering over an item
 - Can be installed Client side only, and doesn't provide any benefit if installed on the server.
 - That's it, it's a small mod, maybe I'll add in more tooltips if I can think of any.
